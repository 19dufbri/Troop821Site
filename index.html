                    <h3>Leadership</h3>
                    <p>Scouts are a great way for young men to learn the important leadership skills needed later in life. The scouts offer this oppertunity through leadership positions and having a troop led by the scouts. Every six months the scouts elect several people to lead the troop and be responsable for jobs such as quartermaster and troop guide. Scouts also learn leadership through the planning of our campouts and other troop activites. Everybody has a chnace to lead a group and will learn lots through the experiences they gain.</p>
